1. Objective:
Create a local, private AI system that tracks user work efforts (across Git commits, emails, Slack discussions) and automatically generates a weekly report matched against a simple list of assigned tasks.


Features:
	â€¢ Task list input (tasks.csv)
	â€¢ Auto-fetch sub-steps like:
		â—‹ Git commits
		â—‹ Email threads
		â—‹ Slack channel discussions
	â€¢ AI Matching: Automatically link activities (commits, emails, messages) to tasks.
	â€¢ Streamlit Dashboard: View progress visually.
	â€¢ Weekly Report: Generate Markdown (later optional PDF).

2. Basic Architecture:
open_source_tracker/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ input/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.csv         # Task list
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git_logs.txt      # Git logs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ emails/           # Outlook .eml files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slack_exports/    # Slack JSON exports
â”œâ”€â”€ fetchers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git_parser.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ email_parser.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slack_parser.py
â”œâ”€â”€ matcher/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai_matcher.py
â”œâ”€â”€ reporter/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ report_generator.py

4. User Inputs and Assumptions:
	â€¢ Upload task list (tasks.csv) manually.
	â€¢ Run git log manually to generate text file.
	â€¢ Export Outlook emails manually to .eml.
	â€¢ Export Slack messages manually (or simulated samples).

6. Other Kickass Project Ideas

ðŸ§  Idea 1: Autonomous Meeting Summarizer + Action Tracker
(Project Code: AutoMeetScribe)
Goal:
	â€¢ Automatically summarize meeting recordings and extract action items.
	â€¢ Assign tasks and reminders through Slack or Email.
Technologies:
	â€¢ Audio-to-Text: Whisper, AssemblyAI
	â€¢ Summarization: T5, Pegasus, BART
	â€¢ Action Detection: NER, Sentence Classification
	â€¢ Frontend: Streamlit
	â€¢ Notifications: Slack Bot or SMTP Email
Why Unique:
	â€¢ Zoom's built-in features are basic, expensive, and not private.
	â€¢ This system will be customizable, private, and extensible.

ðŸ§  Idea 2: Personal Research Paper Assistant
(Project Code: ScholarLens)
Goal:
	â€¢ Upload PDFs of research papers.
	â€¢ Summarize important sections.
	â€¢ Suggest 3â€“5 related papers.
Technologies:
	â€¢ PDF Extraction: PyMuPDF, pdfminer
	â€¢ Summarization: Transformers
	â€¢ Semantic Search: FAISS, ChromaDB
	â€¢ Frontend: Streamlit
Why Unique:
	â€¢ Helps researchers save hours.
	â€¢ Combines NLP, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and dashboarding.

ðŸ§  Idea 3: AI-Driven Debugging Assistant
(Project Code: BugScopeAI)
Goal:
	â€¢ Parse logs, stack traces.
	â€¢ Suggest likely root causes.
	â€¢ Offer fixes based on previous cases.
Technologies:
	â€¢ Log Parsing: regex + ML
	â€¢ Root Cause Classification: Custom LLMs
	â€¢ Vector Search: Past incidents database
	â€¢ Frontend: Streamlit
Why Unique:
	â€¢ Helps developers debug faster.
	â€¢ Shows deep systems thinking and MLOps knowledge.

7. Bonus Fourth Idea:
ðŸ§  Task Complexity Estimator for Project Managers
(Predict effort needed from task descriptions.)

8. Why These Projects Are High-Impact
Skill	Demonstrated By
Data Preprocessing	All projects
NLP Engineering	Summarizer, Research Assistant, BugScopeAI
ML Modeling	Task Estimator, Root Cause Analyzer
Real-world Use Case	Tracker, Summarizer, Debugging
Dashboarding	Streamlit apps for all
Automation	Reminders, reports, alerts

9. Immediate Next Steps Suggested
	â€¢ Build the MVP for the Effort Tracker project (open source Streamlit version).
	â€¢ Then optionally pick one side project among:
		â—‹ AutoMeetScribe (Meeting Summarizer)
		â—‹ ScholarLens (Research Assistant)
		â—‹ BugScopeAI (Debugging Assistant)
	â€¢ Create GitHub repos with strong READMEs.
	â€¢ Add them to your portfolio/resume with a clear "Problem â†’ Solution â†’ Results" format.
